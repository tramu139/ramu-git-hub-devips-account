Ex:  Create a dockerfile, for using ubuntu as base image, and install java in it.
Download jenkins.war  and make execution of "java -jar jenkins.war" as the default process.



Every docker image come with default process.
As long as default process is running, the container will be running condition.

The moment, the default process is closed, the container will be exited.

Lets remove all the container
# docker rm -f $(docker ps -aq)
 

Observation 1:
When we start ubuntu container, we use below command
# docker run --name  c1  -it  ubuntu

/# 

To comeout of the container we use  Ctrl + p + q

# docker container ls
( our container c1  is running in the background )

Observation 2:
When we start jenkins container, we use below command
# docker run --name j1  -d  -P jenkins


Now, I want to open interactive terminal to enter jenkins
# docker  exec -it  j1  bash


( In ubuntu container, I can directly go into -it terminal,
where as in jenkins i am running an additional command  exec ? )


Lets try to go to interactive  terminal  in docker run command )
# docker run  --name  j2  -it  jenkins
( we are not getting interactive terminal )



I want to run tomcat as container
# docker run  --name   t1  -d   -P   tomcat


Lets find the reason
-----------------------
docker container ls  ( to see the list of containers )

Observer the command section.
It tells you the default process that gets executed, when we start the container.

Container			Default process 
tomcat			catalina.sh
jenkins			/bin/tini
ubuntu			/bin/bash

bash -- is nothing but the terminal.

For linux based container, the default process is shell process 
( ex of shell process are  bash shell, bourne shell etc )

Hence we are able to enter -it mode  in ubuntu )



We are trying to change the default process of the container.
-------------------------------------------------------------

# vim dockerfile

FROM ubuntu
MAINTAINER durgasoft

RUN apt-get update
RUN apt-get install -y default-jdk

ADD http://mirrors.jenkins.io/war-stable/latest/jenkins.war  /
ENTRYPOINT ["java","-jar","jenkins.war"]

:wq

Build an image from the dockerfile
# docker build -t  myubuntu  .

TO see the list of images  ( we can see our new image )
# docker image ls

TO start container from new image
# docker run  myubuntu     ( Observe the logs generated on the 
screen, we got logs related to jenkins , jenkins is fully up and running )

Its an ubuntu container, it is behaving as a jenkins container )

Ctrl +c

RUn the below command
# docker ps -a

For myubuntu   the command is  java -jar  jenkins.war
For  ubuntu    the commans is     /bin/bash

Working on docker registry
Registry is a location where docker images are saved.
Types of registry
1) public registry
2) private registry

public registry is hub.docker.com
Images uploaded here are available for everyone.


Usecase: Create a customized ubuntu image, by installing  tree in it.

Save this container as an image, and upload this image in docker hub.

Step 1: Create a new account in hub.docker.com

Step 2: Creating our own container
# docker run --name  c5 -it  ubuntu

Lets install tree package in this container
/# apt-get update
/#  apt-get  install tree
/# exit

Step 3: Save the above container as an image
# docker commit  c5  sunildevops77/ubuntu_img2  
( sunildevops77/ubuntu_img2  -- is the image name )

Note: Image name should start with docker_id/

To see the list of images
# docker image ls  ( we can see the new image )

TO upload the image to hub.docker.com  ( docker login command is used )
-------------------------------------------
# docker login   ( provide docker_id and password )

To upload the image
# docker push  <image_name>
# docker push sunildevops77/ubuntu_img2

login to docker hub to see your image

Container orchestration
------------------------
This is the process of running docker containers in a distributed environment, on multiple docker host machines.
All these containers can have a single service running on them and they share the resources between eachother, even running on different host machines.

Docker swarm is the tool used for performing container orchestration


Advantages
--------------
1) Load balancing
2) scaling of containers
3) performing rolling updates
4) performing rolling network updates
5) handling failover scenarios

Machine on which docker swarm is installed is called as manager.
Other machines are called as workers.


Lets create 3 machines
Name is as Manager, Worker1, Worker2

All the above machines should have docker installed in it.
Install docker using get.docker.com

( Optional step to change the  prompt )
After installing docker in the 1st machine ( Manager ),  Lets change the host name.
Host name will be available in the file hostname. We will change the hostname to manager.

# vim /etc/hostname
Manager

:wq

After changing the hostname, lets restart the machine
# init 6

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Similary repeat the same in worker1 and worker2

++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
Connect to Manager, install docker swarm in it.

$ sudo su -

Command to install docker swarm  in manager machine

# docker swarm init --advertise-addr  private_ip_of_manager
# docker swarm init --advertise-addr  172.31.27.151

Please read the log messages

Now, we need to add workers to manager
Copy the  docker swarm join command in the log and run in the worker1  and worker2

Open another gitbash terminal, connect to worker1

sudo su -

# docker swarm join --token SWMTKN-1-0etsmfa26vreeytq278q8ohhi73il7j1lpnrzzlowuld1r8yex-9x04pjmiq85jxjzjayzlglh1c 172.31.27.151:2377

Repeat for worker2

+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
TO see the no of nodes from the manager

Manager # docker  node ls   ( we can see manager, worker1  and worker 2)
