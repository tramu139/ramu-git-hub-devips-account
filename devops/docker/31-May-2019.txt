In comparison to the traditional virtualization functionalities of hypervisors, Docker containers eliminate the need for a separate guest operating system for every new virtual machine.

Docker implements a high-level API to provide lightweight containers that run processes in isolation. 

A Docker container enables rapid deployment with minimum run-time requirements. It also ensures better management and simplified portability. This helps developers and system admins in rapid deployment of an application.
