Rearrange the commit  order
------------------------------------

git  rebase    --  command is used to arrange the commit order


$ mkdir  demo
$ git  init
$ touch f1
$ git  add .
$ git commit  -m "a"
$ touch f2
$ git  add .
$ git commit  -m "b"
$ touch f3
$ git  add .
$ git commit  -m "c"
$ touch f4
$ git  add .
$ git commit  -m "d"
$ touch f5
$ git  add .
$ git commit  -m "e"
$  git log --oneline    (  a b c d e )

Latest commit is the working version of the code.
I want to change the head pointer.
Note: It is not possible to rearrange the order of 1st commit.



$ git rebase  -i  HEAD~2

$  git log --oneline    (  a b c  e d )

What is vulnerability
What is maven global server?
What is Maven local repository.




What is Maven?
  It is product of apache.
All the open source communities  like  Jenkins, tomcat, mysql etc upload their updated API's into maven global server.

We connect to  the maven global server, download those API  that are necessary for the project development and store them in  Maven local repository.







All  developers connect their projects  to this maven local repository and perform the development activity.





In this way, the code is stored separately in github. and API's required for code development are stored in maven local repository.


This will help in protecting the code from any threats/viruses that might be present in the open source API's.





Maven  is also a build tool. Where it can compile the programs and create a artifact.
