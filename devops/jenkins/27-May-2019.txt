Build pipeline plugin
	This is a plugin, which is used for getting a better graphical user interface for controlling jobs.

PIPELINE as code
---------------------
This is set of plugins  which are used for implementing CI-CD  from the level of code.
This code is created using groovy script, and this file is also called as jenkins file.


Advantges
-----------------
As pipeline is implemented as code, it gives the developers the ability to upload into vesion controlling system from where they can edit and review the script.



Pipelines can accept interactive human input before continuning with specific stage in CI-CD


Ex: Before deployment into production environment, pipeline script can accept  approval
from the delivery head and then continue.




Pipeline script support complex realtime scenario where we can implement conditional statements, loops etc.

Ex: If testing passes, we want to go to delivery.
     If its fails, we want to send automated emails.


Pipeline can be implemented in two ways
1) Scripted pipeline
2) Declarative pipeline


Scripted pipeline syntax:
------------------------------------
node ( 'master/slave')
{
         stage(' Stage in CI-CD')
           {
                   Groovy  code for implementing the stage
           }
}


Declarative pipeline
pipeline
{
     agent  any
     stages
        {
	stage ('Stage in CI-CD')
                    {
                          steps
                              {
                                    Groovy  code for implementing the stage
                               }
                     }
           }
}
